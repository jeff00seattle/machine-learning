# Logistic-Regression

This is logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
The model predicts whether the student gets admitted based on his results on two exams.

This will train the model using historical data from previous applicants.

For each training example, we have the applicantâ€™s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
